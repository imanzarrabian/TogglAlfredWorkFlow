# TogglAlfredWorkFlow
A python workflow for Alfred 2 making my life easier when using Toggl

This is based on the excellent alfred-workflow from [deanishe](https://github.com/deanishe) : [http://www.deanishe.net/alfred-workflow/](http://www.deanishe.net/alfred-workflow/)

**Usage:**
* For now the WID is hard coded (I know), so replace the "YOUR_WID_HERE" by the int value of your Toggl WID in both toggl.py and togglTimer.py
* When installed, you need to use the **tgKey** keyword to set your Toggl APIKey
* You're then good to go : use th "tg" keywork (or whatever keyword you configured), select a project and press tab to autocomplete. Finally add ":" and enter you time in minutes. This will create a time entry for the given project for today!
